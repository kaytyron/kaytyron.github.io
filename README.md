Knack for efficient problem solving, determined, innovative and enterprising with
exceptional capabilities of productive management and leadership.
I need to add this so I can reach a number of commits.

* Design - I really have a passion for all things beautiful :wink:
* Code - I love to talk to my laptop.
* Program - I can tell the computer what to do and when to do it
* Lead - Another line of commits

I lost all my uploads from yesterday and now i am redoing it
My bash on windows is annoying me now.
